This repository contains RP3 Group 7's assigned Python Notebook (based off the design created and provided by Dr. Cousins) and any other scripts written for the purposes of this RP.

Specifically, this includes:
- The Phase 1 technology models for assigned technologies Fermentation and Nuclear Fission (with completed writeups as needed)
    - data for fermentation utilized what was originally included by Dr. Cousins. The dataset for Nuclear Energy has been editied to better reflect the needs of an SMR wich has a capacity of 100MW instead of 1000MW (divided everything
      by 10)
- The associated phase 2 exercises and models, notably the production of a power-time series from the data and toy demand profile.
    - Additional plots and code were added to account for the hydrogen production via High-Temperature Steam Electrolysis (H-TSE or HTSE)
